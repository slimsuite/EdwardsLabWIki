# Creating the EdwardsLabWiki github
This page gives an overview of the creation process for the `EdwardsLabWiki` using [GitHub][1] and associated git tools and commands.

## Step 1: Create GitHub repository
See instructions on GitHub if unsure. I created a [README.md][2] file to have a git repo for cloning in this case. The alternative is to create an empty repo and push into it. I'll be trying this below with the wiki!

## Step 2: Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/slimsuite/EdwardsLabWiki.git
```
As I am intending to push the same repo into the wiki, I copied the [README.md][2] file as the wiki's initial [HOME.md][3] page:
```
cp README.md Home.md
```
I then made the initial version of this [Creation.md][4] file. Within this, I am trying some "local" markdown file links, e.g. `[Home.md](./Home.md)`. I am not sure whether this works!

## Step 3: Create the wiki repository
I use the **GitHub Desktop App** for generating my commits and **GitUp** for visualising the branching structure - **WARNING:** I intend to make use of branching for this repo!
**NOTE:** I tried to do this by creating a new branch and pushing:
```
git branch wiki
git checkout wiki
git remote add githubwiki https://github.com/slimsuite/EdwardsLabWiki.wiki.git
git push -u githubwiki master
```
This did not work!:
```
remote: Not Found
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/slimsuite/EdwardsLabWiki.wiki.git/' not found
```
Â» Needed to create the wiki repo first on github. This was made with a `Temp.md` file to avoid conflicts when trying to merge repos. Here we go...

## Step 4: Merge repos
An inital attempt to push to the repo was rejected because it had files needing to be merged. I think the following can be simplified, but here is what I did...

**4.1. Merge in the wiki**

```
git remote add githubwiki https://github.com/slimsuite/EdwardsLabWiki.wiki.git    
git pull githubwiki master
```
This generate a merge in the `wiki` branch but it could still not be pushed to the repo.

**4.2. Make a new merger branch**

```
git checkout -b merger --track githubwiki/master
git merge wiki
```
This was then pushed to the Wiki repo.

**4.3. Merge and push main repo.**

The `wiki` branch seemed surplus to requirements. Will try removing it and renaming merger to wiki. Then move master to point at the same commit.
