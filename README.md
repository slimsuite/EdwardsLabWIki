Edwards Lab Wiki for miscellaneous documentation development.

This is initially for testing documentation in GitHub but will be expanded in time with a range of educational and bioinformatics training pages. Maybe.

The main page of this is the accompanying [Wiki][1]:

* [Home][1] - Wiki home page.
* [Creation][2] - Notes on the `git` code used whilst making these pages.
